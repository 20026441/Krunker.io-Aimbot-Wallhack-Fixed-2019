#### Beta V7.2.0, Updated Feb 21 2019

##### Please Scroll down and read through almost everything! (Following me and starring this repository would be helpful)

SINCE NOBODY SEEMS TO FIX THE LATEST KRUNKER ISSUE OF 2019, I WILL FIX IT, FOLLOW THE BELOW STEPS TO GET IT!!!

PLEASE STAR THIS REPOSITORY!!! Updates are released after every krunker update or improvements to be intergrated

# Instructions

###### Requirements: Tampermonkey
Download Tampermonkey from the chrome web store and then press on the link below to install the script.
Do not press the install button if you do not have Tampermonkey extension.

Press here to install : https://greasyfork.org/scripts/377516-krunker-io-aimbot-wallhack-2019-fixed-and-more/code/Krunkerio%20aimbot,%20wallhack,%202019%20fixed,%20and%20more!!!.user.js

# IMPORTANT FOR THE HACK MENU
The hack menu will not apear until you press 'click to play' and a popup will open for the settings, do not quit the pop-up as for now it is the only way to control the hack, soon this extension will also support moomoo.io as both games are made by the same developer and this will turn into a double compatible extension. If the hack menu doesn't work then please tel me this in The issues tab. 

# More Notices
PLEASE DO NOT FORK THIS, ONLY LOSERS WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO CODE DO SO, I WANT TO WORK ON IT BY MYSELF!! PLS PLS PLS.
